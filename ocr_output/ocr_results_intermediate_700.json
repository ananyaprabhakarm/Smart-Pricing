Its name is derived from the French term for \"wild,\" reflecting its unrestrained growth and bold flavors. This grape variety thrives in diverse climates, producing wines that range from crisp and herbaceous to tropical and fruity. In cooler regions, you can expect wines to showcase a lively acidity with green bell pepper and grassy notes, while warmer areas enhance the fruit profile, leading to delightful tropical flavors. Chilean Sauvignon Blanc is particularly celebrated for its citrusy brightness, moving away from the greener characteristics often associated with the grape. Instead, it highlights a luscious mix of stone fruits, passion fruit, and zesty lime, presenting a more refined take on this beloved varietal. The winemaking conditions in Chile, marked by a combination of warm days and cool evenings, allow for optimal ripening while retaining essential acidity. The VineCo Chilean Sauvignon Blanc captures the essence of this grape beautifully. It offers a lively bouquet of herbaceous notes intertwined with enticing flavors of stone fruit and tropical delights. This dry white wine is crafted without oak, maintaining its fresh character. This wine kit encourages you to enjoy the Sauvignon Blanc at its peak freshness. With no aging required, you can indulge in its crisp flavors shortly after bottling. Its versatility means it pairs wonderfully with a variety of dishes, making it a fantastic option for any meal, from light appetizers to vibrant salads and even sushi. Experience the joy of pairing this delightful wine with your culinary creations. Ingredient Kit Only Does Not Contain Alcohol.\nValue: 1.0\nUnit: Count\n",

They are now found all over the world from places like Madagascar to Indonesia to Papa New Guinea PNG farms. The scent consists of a heavenly buttery aroma with a rich, black or dark brown color and a very oily outside surface. The interior of the bean is where the magic is at and consists of millions of black, tiny vanilla seeds that are waiting to be scraped out. Our beans are traditionally cured to develop the full, complex vanilla flavor made of over 200 organic compounds and artificial vanilla (vanillin) cannot properly replicate the complexity of natural vanilla. The entire process takes anywhere from 6 to 9 months after pollination and our farmers have turned vanilla processing and curing into an art. This region remains the industry quality benchmark for producing vanilla planifolia with high vanillin content. <br><br>There are so many recipes that can be created with vanilla beans! Desserts such as vanilla bean ice cream, creme brulee, cup cakes, or cookies can be created with these magical beans. Homemade KAHLUA or Vanilla Extract is also a very popular gift & can be made using a simple vodka infusion method! Bonus points for using the spent vanilla beans after the extract making process for creating vanilla sugar!<br><br>Our beans are triple inspected throughout their journey. First, they are inspected by our farmers who have hundreds of years of experience. The second inspection is before bulk storage for transport. The final inspection is done at our warehouse moments before packing your shipment where we check the smell, quality, and appearance.\nValue: 5.0\nUnit: Count\n",

Keep them refrigerated, can last up to 5 years!\nProduct Description: Blanched Peanuts are highly used in sweet and savory applications in various cuisines, including American, Chinese, and Thai. One of the most common uses of Blanched Peanuts is in the production of peanut butter, a crunchy or creamy spread. Peanut, also known as groundnut and goober (Arachis hypogaea), is a crop of global importance. It is widely grown in the tropics and subtropics, being important to both smallholder and large commercial producers. It is classified as both a grain legume and, because of its high oil content, an oil crop. World annual production is about 46 million tonnes per year. Peanut pods develop under the ground, which is very unusual among crop plants. One cup of raw peanuts contains approximately 828 calories, 72 grams of fat, 37 grams of protein, 24 grams of carbohydrates, 12 grams of fiber and 10 grams of saturated fat. These numbers constitute 110 percent of the daily value of fat, 73 percent of protein, 50 percent of saturated fat, 19 percent of fiber and 8 percent of carbohydrates. Raw peanuts have a negligible amount of sodium and are cholesterol free. Raw peanuts' low carbohydrate-to-protein ratio makes them a good snack choice for people following low-carbohydrate, high-protein diets.\nValue: 96.0\nUnit: Ounce\n",

It’s the ideal freshen up gum that is also good for your teeth. Our gum is conveniently packed with a screw on lid container so you can stay fresh on the road, at work, or with your friends. The natural spearmint gives a blast of cool, refreshing flavor, which provides a nice alternative to other aspartame free gum.\nBullet Point 2: IMPROVES TOOTH DENTAL CARE: Clinical studies have shown that the use of xylitol on a daily basis may reduce the risk of tooth decay. Our spry gum is part of an essential dental defense system that may also help fight off cavities. Xylitol is a natural ingredient that inhibits contaminants' ability to stick to your teeth. When contaminants can't stick, they can't colonize. Ask your dentist and hygienist about the amazing benefits of xylitol.\nBullet Point 3: SUGAR FREE XYLITOL GUM: Instead of corn syrup or sugar our gum is made with 100% xylitol. Xylitol sweetener is derived from the fibrous parts of plants, similar in taste to regular organic sugar. We use no filler, flow agents or other sugar additives. Xylitol is a natural sugar that tastes just like real sugar and a great choice when looking for sweetners and sugar alternatives.\nBullet Point 4: NON-GMO GLUTEN FREE NATURAL GUM: Unlike other packs of gum, Spry gum uses natural ingredients that are Non GMO and gluten free. Spry Xylitol gum is 40% lower in calories than other mint gum that contain regular sugars, but contains the same sweetness. It can be a great choice for using in diabetic foods and snacks, keto friendly foods or used in blood sugar support supplements.\nBullet Point 5: FIGHTS BAD BREATH: Use daily after meals and between normal brushes. For best results use Spry Spearmint Gum with Spry Coolmint Toothpaste and Spry Coolmint Oral Rinse for a fresh breath. Spry Spearmint Chewing Gum can help prevent bad breath caused by a poor pH balance, dry mouth, and the lack of saliva. Chewing xylitol gum after meals can increase your saliva output and help neutralize the acids that cause bad breath.\nValue: 550.0\nUnit: Count\n",

This type of malt is created by allowing rye grain to sprout and then drying it in a kiln. The result is a unique flavor profile characterized by spiciness, earthiness, and a hint of sweetness. Brewers often use rye malt in various beer styles, like rye beer, and it is also a key component in whiskey production. When incorporating rye malt into your brewing process, it's suggested to add it in 5% increments until you achieve the desired flavor. If you're using more than 20% rye malt, it's advisable to include rice hulls to help with the brewing process. Rye malt brings a distinct taste that cannot be replicated by other malts, making it an excellent choice for a variety of beers. While it adds a special touch to pale ales, lagers, porters, and IPAs, it's important to note that working with rye malt in home brewing can pose challenges. However, with some adjustments to your brewing technique, you can create exceptional and flavorful brews using rye malt.\nValue: 1.0\nUnit: Count\n",
